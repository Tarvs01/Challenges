[CHALLENGE]

TheÂ Euler NumberÂ e is used as the base of natural logarithm.

It can be approximated using the formula:
e = 1 + 1 / 1! + 1 / 2! + 1 / 3! + â€¦ 1 / n!

Write a program in any language that approximates e using a loop that terminates when the difference between two successive values of e differ by less than 0.00000001.
