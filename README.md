This project contains some miscellaneous challenges that I have done over the years. Quite a few of them were done with C, that is because C was the first language I learned and since I did not know Arduino, the only good thing I could do with C was to use it to solve challenges.

Some of the challenges are console graphics, so they only make sense to do with a console/terminal.

Majority of the challenges are from sololearn.

<h1>Enjoy!</h1>
